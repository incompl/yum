# Yum!

## Setup

* Install [Bower](http://bower.io/) if needed
* Run `bower install`
* Open `index.html` in a browser

## Build

You don't need to build to develop since the application runs without building. If you run `grunt` the application is built into the `dest` directory with minified code, etc.
